#Variables

Variables are the main way of storing values in a prance program.

Each variable contains a name and a type.

`var name: String`

In the above example we create a new variable called 'name' with the type 'String'.
Generally variable names will start with a lower-case letter and types will start
with an upper-case letter.

In order to use our variable we must store a value into it, we do this with the `=` operator.

`name = "Tristan"`

Now the variable name contains the value 'Tristan'. We can modify it with more
assignment statements and we can pass it into Functions

Code:
`print(line: name)`

Output:
`Tristan`
