# Operators

Prance defines two types of operators, arithmetic operators that transform
numerical values and logical operators that provide comparisons between values.

## Arithmetic Operators

There are 5 arithmetic operators:
`+` - Add 2 values
`-` - Subtract right value from the left value
`/` - Divide left value by the right value
`*` - Multiply 2 values
`%` - Modulo left value by right value

## Logical Operators

There are 7 logical operators:
`&&` - Logical AND, true if both values are true
`||` - Logical OR, true if either value is true
`==` - Equals, true if the values are the same
`!=` - Not Equals, true if the values are different
`<` - Less than, true if the left number is strictly lower than the right
`<=` - Less than or equal, true if the left number is lower or equal to the right
`>` - Greater than, true if the left number is higher than the right
`>=` - Greater than or equal, true if the left number is higher of equal to the right

### Truthiness
A value is defined as true if it is a non-zero Int, Double or Float. Logical operations
all return either '1'(true) or '0'(false).
